## 1. Forecast Results Summary

| Year | Access (Baseline) | Access (Low–High) | Usage (Baseline) | Usage (Low–High) |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 2025 | ~56%              | 54–58%            | ~34%             | 33–35%           |
| 2026 | ~58%              | 56–60%            | ~36%             | 34–37%           |
| 2027 | ~60%              | 58–62%            | ~38%             | 36–39%           |

## 2. Key Drivers

1. **M-Pesa (2023)**: Competition and network effects support both access and usage.
2. **Telebirr scale-up**: Dominant player continues to drive account growth.
3. **Interoperability**: Cross-platform transactions support usage activation.
4. **National Financial Inclusion Strategy**: Policy framing and targets guide sector development.

## 3. Largest-Impact Events

- **Telebirr Launch (2021)**: Strongest observed impact on Access and Usage.
- **NFIS (2020)**: Long-run policy and coordination effects.
- **M-Pesa Launch (2023)**: Near-term boost to competition and awareness.

## 4. Structural Constraints and Risks

- **Usage gap**: Usage lags access; many accounts remain inactive.
- **Infrastructure saturation**: Access growth may slow as penetration rises.
- **Risks**: Macro volatility, regulatory shifts, slow rural and last-mile rollout.

## 5. Policy Relevance

- **Baseline scenario**: Plausible trajectory if current dynamics persist.
- **Optimistic**: Successful policy execution and strong operator adoption.
- **Pessimistic**: Headwinds (macro, regulatory, operational) limit growth.
- **Recommendation**: Focus on usage activation and rural coverage to shift toward optimistic outcomes.
